The main objective of the established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is to ensure
alignment of strategy, processes, people, technology and funds in order to identify, evaluate
and manage opportunities, uncertainties and threats in a structured and disciplined manner and
geared towards achieving strategic objectives.
</p>
<p>
As part of the reporting requirements contained in the Risk Management Policy and Procedures,
Management is mandated to report on a periodic basis to the Board on the extent of implementation
of risk management strategies.  This report presents progress made in the implementation of risk
mitigation strategies established under the Enterprise Risk Management Framework that was adopted by
the Board in August 2017. Presented below is the risk assessment and ranking methodology adopted;

Two other Firms Belrium and Pyypl have been given no objections to develop the product and the related infrastructure before their admission to the Regulatory Sandbox.
The SRC is finalizing on a few outstanding issues to support the exit of Genghis Capital Limited from the Regulatory Sandbox following the successful testing of Gencap Wekeza Mobile Unit Trust product also known as ‘Mali’ during a nine-month testing period. The testing was done in collaboration with Safaricom Limited. Consequently, the Authority has granted a ‘letter of no objection’ to the licensed Investment Bank, to roll out the product at commercial scale to the open market.
