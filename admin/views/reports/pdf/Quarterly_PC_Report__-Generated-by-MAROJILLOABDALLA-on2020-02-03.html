Two other Firms Belrium and Pyypl have been given no objections to develop the product and the related infrastructure before their admission to the Regulatory Sandbox.
The SRC is finalizing on a few outstanding issues to support the exit of Genghis Capital Limited from the Regulatory Sandbox following the successful testing of Gencap Wekeza Mobile Unit Trust product also known as ‘Mali’ during a nine-month testing period. The testing was done in collaboration with Safaricom Limited. Consequently, the Authority has granted a ‘letter of no objection’ to the licensed Investment Bank, to roll out the product at commercial scale to the open market.
