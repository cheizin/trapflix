The main objective of the established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is to ensure
alignment of strategy, processes, people, technology and funds in order to identify, evaluate
and manage opportunities, uncertainties and threats in a structured and disciplined manner and
geared towards achieving strategic objectives.
</p>
<p>
As part of the reporting requirements contained in the Risk Management Policy and Procedures,
Management is mandated to report on a periodic basis to the Board on the extent of implementation
of risk management strategies.  This report presents progress made in the implementation of risk
mitigation strategies established under the Enterprise Risk Management Framework that was adopted by
the Board in August 2017. Presented below is the risk assessment and ranking methodology adopted;
